We are witnessing a paradigm-shift: if once, background knowledge was scarce and difficult to explore, nowadays Semantic Web technologies are empowering the access to background knowledge in the form of ontologies, and more and more data are being released as Linked Data. The data mining methods of the future need to be able to combine the external knowledge encoded in ontologies and provided by linked data sets with the analysis of empirical data.

In the SMiLAX project, we propose to tackle the challenge presented by this paradigm shift by developing novel algorithms and approaches for knowledge discovery that leverage on the new emerging Semantic Web technologies and the abundance of knowledge made available through them.

SMiLAX is funded by the Fundação Portuguesa para a Ciência e Tecnologia (PTDC/EEI-ESS/4633/2014)
